<details> <summary>:package: Synhelper</summary> <ul>

### Idea

Synhelper was a hacker in Europe whose I tried to take on the challenge of solving some problem, I tried to create an application that helped farmers see their plants and their plantation fields

```

### How it was developed?

Well, I came up with this solution thinking that a simple monitoring system would be good in relation to how farmers and people in the fields are simple, so leaving everything centralized on the cell phone would be super simpler. However, I think the idea could be improved a lot.
